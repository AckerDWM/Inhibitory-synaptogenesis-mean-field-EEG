**Figure legend.** Effect of increased GABAergic synapse density on simulated LFP in the Wendling-Chauvel model. LFP was simulated in the Wendling-Chauvel model across a wide range of conditions. (**A**) Log de-trended LFP power under all simulated conditions. Synapse number alterations were baseline (Control), a 30% increase in IE synapses (IE), and a 30% increase in both IE and II synapses (II). The variable A is excitatory synaptic gain, B is slow inhibitory synaptic gain, and G is fast inhibitory synaptic gain. (**B**) Log de-trended LFP power versus synapse number alteration and excitatory synaptic gain. Green asterisks indicate a decrease compared to control at the corresponding level of excitatory synaptic gain; red asterisks indicate an increase. ***p<0.001, **p<0.01, two-tailed Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni corrections. (**C**) Simulated LFP demonstrating seizure abolition by increased GABAergic synapse number. This effect was not reversed in the II condition. Simulation parameters: A=5, B=35, G=28.
